<section class="rules">
  <h3>🏁 Event Format</h3>
  <p>Each competitive heat starts with participants at the base of the slide. They race up and slide down as fast as they can. Top finishers advance to semi-finals and then finals.</p>

  <h3>🎲 How Betting Works</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>All betting is <strong>parimutuel</strong> – winners split the losers’ money, proportionally.</li>
    <li>Odds are dynamic and update immediately as bets come in.</li>
    <li>You can bet any amount. If your bet wins, your payout is based on how many others also picked that outcome.</li>
    <li>There are no shorts, and you can't lose more than you bet.</li>
    <li>If a competitor drops out, bets on them are refunded.</li>
    <li>3% of all wagers go to local charities.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>📅 Markets</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Who will advance</strong> from each heat</li>
    <li><strong>Who will win</strong> each overall competition</li>
    <li><strong>Prop bets</strong> (e.g. Nir vs. Greg, winning department)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>📧 Eligibility</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Bets must be placed using your <strong>work email</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>No proxy betting</strong> – only bet for yourself.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>💬 Chatter & Support</h3>
